The last option which finally worked for me was: Visual Foxpro OLE Driver.

You could update forxpro to Foxpro Sp2 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13959" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13959</a>).

Sample code looks like

$conn = new COM("ADODB.Connection");
$conn->Open('Provider=VFPOLEDB.1;Data Source="C:\\testDB.dbc";'); 

$query = "SELECT * FROM TABLE1 ";
$rs = $conn->Execute($query) or die("Error in query: $query. " . $conn->ErrorMsg());
while (!$rs->EOF) {
    echo " Got COL1: " . $rs->Fields("COL1") . " :: COL2: " . $rs->Fields("COL2") . " id: " . $rs->Fields("ID") . "\n";
    $rs->MoveNext();
}

$query = "UPDATE TABLE1 set COL1 = \"AA\", COL2 = \"Updated value\" ";
$conn->Execute($query);

<h2>The user profile service service failed the logon</h2>
<pre>
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947215.

You receive a "The User Profile Service failed the logon” error message 

Click Start, type regedit in the Search box, and then press ENTER.
In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
In the navigation pane, locate the folder that begins with S-1-5 (SID key) followed by a long number.
Click each S-1-5 folder, locate the ProfileImagePath entry in the details pane, and then double-click to make sure that this is the user account profile that has the error.
If you have two folders starting with S-1-5 followed by some long numbers and one of them ended with .bak, you have to rename the .bak folder. To do this, follow these steps:

    Right-click the folder without .bak, and then click Rename. Type .ba, and then press ENTER.
    2493038
    Right-click the folder that is named .bak, and then click Rename. Remove .bak at the end of the folder name, and then press ENTER.
    2493039
    Right-click the folder that is named .ba, and then click Rename. Change the .ba to .bak at the end of the folder name, and then press ENTER.
    2493040

If you have only one folder starting with S-1-5 that is followed by long numbers and ends with .bak. Right-click the folder, and then click Rename. Remove .bak at the end of the folder name, and then press ENTER.

Click the folder without .bak in the details pane, double-click RefCount, type 0, and then click OK.

Click the folder without .bak, in the details pane, double-click State, type 0, and then click OK.

Close Registry Editor.
Restart the computer.

<h2>Let me fix it myself</h2>
Warning Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. <br />These problems might require that you reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk.

To manually reset a registry key, you must first delete it. To do this, follow these steps.

Important Always export a registry key before you delete it. This step is important because you may have to restore the functionality that is provided by the key.

    Exit all Microsoft Office programs.
    Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.
    Expand the appropriate folders to locate the registry key that you want to delete. (Refer to the "Main locations of Word settings in the Windows Registry" section.)
    Click to select the key that you want to delete.
    Use one of the following methods, as appropriate for your operating system:
        In Microsoft Windows 2000, click Export Registry File on the Registry menu, type a file name for the backup copy of the key, and then click Save.
        In Windows XP and later versions or in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and later versions, click Export on the File menu, type a file name for the backup copy of the key, and then click Save.
    Make sure that the key that you just exported is selected, and then click Delete on the Edit menu.
    When you are prompted to respond to one of the following messages, click Yes:
        Are you sure you want to delete this key?
        Are you sure you want to delete this key and all of its subkeys?
    Exit Registry Editor.

After you delete a registry key, and then you restart the program, Word runs the Setup program to correctly rebuild the registry key. If you want to rebuild the registry key before you run the program, repair your installation by following the steps in the "Repair Word (Office)" section.

Word 2000
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Word
Changes made to this HKEY_CURRENT_USER key are mirrored in the following keys for Word 2003, for Word 2002, and for Word 2000:

Word 2003
HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word
Word 2002
HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Office\10.0\Word
Word 2000
HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Word
The difference between the "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" location and the HKEY_USER" location is that the first applies only to the current user of the system, and the second is the default location for all users. However, Word entries are the same for both locations. Therefore, any change that is made to one location is automatically reflected in the other location.

Note For the rest of this section, all references to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER tree apply also to the HKEY_USERS tree, except for the 2007 Microsoft Office 2007 programs and where otherwise noted.

The Data key and the Options key are the most frequently changed areas.

 All you need to do is add entries to the hosts file in %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc location. If you add w.x.y.z machinea and w.x.y.z machineb w.x.y.z machinec and so on (changing w.x.y.z to the ip address of the machine you wish to connect to of course) then you can connect to/map drives to \machinea\user1share \machineb\user2share \machinec\user3share and so on
