<h2>Cloning an SD Card on Linux or Mac</h2>
<pre>
http://mikelev.in/2010/09/cloning-an-sd-card-on-linux/

Identify the name of your sd card in the /dev directory
dmesg | tail
What this does is it pipes your device messages into the tail command, showing you the last 10 device messages you’ve received. One of them will be the one created by popping the SD card in, and will probably look something like:
[  335.316290]  sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk

Now that your SD card s installed and you know that it is called /dev/sdb (or whatever), you can go ahead and copy the entire raw disk image to your hard drive.
dd if=/dev/sdb of=~/sd-card.bin

Now you can copy image to sd card. Put new sd card to sc card reader. if sdcard is in /dev/sdb then
dd if=/path-to/sd-card.bin of=/dev/sdb

<h1>Configuring virtual network interfaces in Linux (without libvirt)</h1>

<pre>
http://linuxconfig.org/configuring-virtual-network-interfaces-in-linux

Note: Dont forget to turn on masquerading in firewall and in /etc/sysctl.conf file set 1 to net.ipv4.ip_forward (net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1)

1. Introduction

Did you know that you can assign more that one IP address to a single physical network interface? 
This technique is quite useful, for example when working with Apache and virtual hosts, as it allows you to access same Apache server by using two different IP addresses.

2. Temporary virtual network interface

The process of creating a virtual network interface in Linux is a quite simple matter. It involves a single execution of the ifconfig command.

ifconfig eth0:0 123.123.22.22

The above command will create a new virtual network interface based on original eth0 physical interface. 
The only most important condition for creating the virtual network interface is the physical network interface, as in our case eth0 must exists. 
The whole example is shown below:

# ifconfig eth0 
eth0 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 3c:97:0e:02:98:c8  
inet addr:192.168.100.23  Bcast:192.168.100.255  
Mask:255.255.255.0

# ping 192.168.100.23
PING 192.168.100.23  bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.100.23 time=0.023 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.100.23 time=0.059 m

At this point we can configure a new virtual interface based on eth0. 
Once you execute the ifconfig command the new virtual interface will be immediately ready to use.

# ifconfig eth0:0
eth0:0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 3c:97:0e:02:98:c8  
          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          Interrupt:20 Memory:f1600000-f1620000 

# ifconfig eth0:0 123.123.22.22
# ifconfig eth0:0
eth0:0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 3c:97:0e:02:98:c8  
          inet addr:123.123.22.22  Bcast:123.255.255.255  Mask:255.0.0.0

# ping 123.123.22.22
PING 123.123.22.22 (123.123.22.22) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 123.123.22.22: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.060 ms
64 bytes from 123.123.22.22: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.057 ms

2.1.  Disable virtual network interface

To disable our temporary network interface created earlier we can use the ifconfig command again but with a down flag.

# ifconfig eth0:0 down

3. Virtual address permanent assignment

The above configuration would not last after reboot. 
If you wish the virtual network interface to be permanent you would need to modify config files relevant to your particular Linux distribution. 
Below, you can find information describing this procedure for the major Linux distributions:

3.1. Debian / Ubuntu
3.1.1. Static

For Debian or Ubuntu Linux you need to edit /etc/network/interfaces file with your favorite text editor and add the following lines:

iface eth0:0 inet static
address 123.123.22.22
netmask 255.0.0.0
broadcast 123.255.255.255

3.1.2. Dhcp

It is also possible to use virtual network interface with DHCP. In that case, you will need to add to your /etc/network/interfaces the following line.

iface eth0:0 inet dhcp

To apply your change restart the network with:

 # /etc/init.d/networking restart

3.2. Redhat / Fedora / CentOS
3.2.1. Static

For Redhat, Fedora or CentOS Linux the directory responsible for permanent IP address assignment is /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts. 
In this directory you need to create a file corresponding to your new virtual interface. 
In our case, that will be a file called: ifcfg-eth0:0. 
Create this new file and insert following lines to make your virtual address assignment permanent after reboot:

DEVICE=eth0:0
IPADDR=123.123.22.22
NETMASK=255.0.0.0
NETWORK=123.0.0.0
BROADCAST=123.255.255.255
ONBOOT=yes

3.2.2. Dhcp

DEVICE=eth0:0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes

Once ready restart your interfaces with:

# service network restart

4. Conclusion

In the old days one physical server served a single website. This is no longer a viable option for hosting websites today so ability of an operating system to create virtual network interface is really a must."

samba shared directory usualy is located in sub directory, and sometimes it is not with users home directory and is located in different path

when we are trying to acces directory error occured with message that we have not permission
one of solution is to check permission
if it is mounted disk for example /mnt/sambadisk
then /mnt/sambadisk must have 755 mode
and all parent directories for concrete users shared directory must have also 755 mode 
chmod 755 /pathtoparentdirectory
and after just users share directory maybe limited with 0700 mode
for example 
chmod 0700 /pathtoparentdirectory/shareddirectory

<h1>Creating RAID 5 (Striping with Distributed Parity) in Linux</h1>
<pre>
<a href="https://www.tecmint.com/create-raid-5-in-linux/">https://www.tecmint.com/create-raid-5-in-linux/</a>

yum install mdadm

After the ‘mdadm‘ package installation, let’s list the three 20GB disks which we have added in our system using ‘fdisk‘ command.

fdisk -l | grep sd
Now it’s time to examine the attached three drives for any existing RAID blocks on these drives using following command.

mdadm -E /dev/sd[b-d]
mdadm --examine /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd

Note: From the above image illustrated that there is no any super-block detected yet. So, there is no RAID defined in all three drives. Let us start to create one now.

Partitioning the Disks for RAID
First and foremost, we have to partition the disks (/dev/sdb, /dev/sdc and /dev/sdd) before adding to a RAID, So let us define the partition using ‘fdisk’ command, before forwarding to the next steps.

fdisk /dev/sdb
fdisk /dev/sdc
fdisk /dev/sdd

Create /dev/sdb Partition

Please follow the below instructions to create partition on /dev/sdb drive.

    Press ‘n‘ for creating new partition.
    Then choose ‘P‘ for Primary partition. Here we are choosing Primary because there is no partitions defined yet.
    Then choose ‘1‘ to be the first partition. By default it will be 1.
    Here for cylinder size we don’t have to choose the specified size because we need the whole partition for RAID so just Press Enter two times to choose the default full size.
    Next press ‘p‘ to print the created partition.
    Change the Type, If we need to know the every available types Press ‘L‘.
    Here, we are selecting ‘fd‘ as my type is RAID.
    Next press ‘p‘ to print the defined partition.
    Then again use ‘p‘ to print the changes what we have made.
    Use ‘w‘ to write the changes.
Note: We have to follow the steps mentioned above to create partitions for sdc & sdd drives too.

Create /dev/sdc Partition

Now partition the sdc and sdd drives by following the steps given in the screenshot or you can follow above steps.

fdisk /dev/sdc

Create /dev/sdd Partition

fdisk /dev/sdd

After creating partitions, check for changes in all three drives sdb, sdc, & sdd.

mdadm --examine /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
or
mdadm -E /dev/sd[b-c]

Note: In the above pic. depict the type is fd i.e. for RAID.

Now Check for the RAID blocks in newly created partitions. If no super-blocks detected, than we can move forward to create a new RAID 5 setup on these drives.

mdadm --examine /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1

Creating md device md0

Now create a Raid device ‘md0‘ (i.e. /dev/md0) and include raid level on all newly created partitions (sdb1, sdc1 and sdd1) using below command.

mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
or
mdadm -C /dev/md0 -l=5 -n=3 /dev/sd[b-d]1

After creating raid device, check and verify the RAID, devices included and RAID Level from the mdstat output.

cat /proc/mdstat

After creation of raid, Verify the raid devices using the following command.

mdadm -E /dev/sd[b-d]1

Note: The Output of the above command will be little long as it prints the information of all three drives.

Next, verify the RAID array to assume that the devices which we’ve included in the RAID level are running and started to re-sync.

mdadm --detail /dev/md0

Creating file system for md0

Create a file system for ‘md0‘ device using ext4 before mounting.

mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0

Now create a directory under ‘/mnt‘ then mount the created filesystem under /mnt/raid5 and check the files under mount point, you will see lost+found directory.

mkdir /mnt/raid5
mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid5/
ls -l /mnt/raid5/

 Create few files under mount point /mnt/raid5 and append some text in any one of the file to verify the content.

touch /mnt/raid5/raid5_tecmint_{1..5}
ls -l /mnt/raid5/
echo "tecmint raid setups" > /mnt/raid5/raid5_tecmint_1
cat /mnt/raid5/raid5_tecmint_1
cat /proc/mdstat

We need to add entry in fstab, else will not display our mount point after system reboot. To add an entry, we should edit the fstab file and append the following line as shown below. The mount point will differ according to your environment.

# vim /etc/fstab
/dev/md0                /mnt/raid5              ext4    defaults        0 0

Next, run ‘mount -av‘ command to check whether any errors in fstab entry.

mount -av

Save Raid 5 Configuration

As mentioned earlier in requirement section, by default RAID don’t have a config file. We have to save it manually. If this step is not followed RAID device will not be in md0, it will be in some other random number.

So, we must have to save the configuration before system reboot. If the configuration is saved it will be loaded to the kernel during the system reboot and RAID will also gets loaded.

mdadm --detail --scan --verbose >> /etc/mdadm.conf

<h1>Raid replace disk</h1>

<pre>
to replace disk at /dev/sdc
first remove old bad disk or anyway reason for it and add new at the same place
examine what disks are availabe for raid from /dev/sdb to /dev/sdc
mdadm -E /dev/sd[b-c]
then create disk with fdisk command

for our example we hawe raid on /dev/md0 and mounted to /mnt/raid1

fdisk /dev/sdc
n -- to create new partition
          p -- to make partition primary
p - to print status

unmount mount point
umoint /mnt/raid1
stop raid with
mdadm --stop /dev/md0


to remove disk from array
Before removing a disk we have to mark the disk as failed one, then only we can able to remove it.
mdadm --fail /dev/md0 /dev/sdc1
mdadm --detail /dev/md0
mdadm --remove /dev/md0 /dev/sdc1
mdadm --detail /dev/md0
mount | grep raid1
ls -l /mnt/raid1 | grep tecmint
cat /mnt/raid1/tecmint.txt

mdadm --detail /dev/md0

#you must  be out of directory where is mounted /dev/md0, because mdadm wil show error that mount is busy
#after that add new disk to raid array with command

mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --add /dev/sdc1

Next check the raid devices type and raid array using following commands.

# mdadm -E /dev/sd[b-c]1
# mdadm --detail /dev/md0

mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid1

<h1>Raid Recovering from a Redundancy Loss</h1>

<pre>
As explained earlier, mdadm will automatically rebuild the data when one disk fails. But what happens if 2 disks in the array fail? Let’s simulate such scenario by marking /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdd1 as faulty:

umount /mnt/raid1
mdadm --manage --set-faulty /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1
mdadm --stop /dev/md0
mdadm --manage --set-faulty /dev/md0 /dev/sdd1

Attempts to re-create the array the same way it was created at this time (or using the --assume-clean option) may result in data loss, so it should be left as a last resort.

Let’s try to recover the data from /dev/sdb1, for example, into a similar disk partition (/dev/sde1 – note that this requires that you create a partition of type fd in /dev/sde before proceeding) using ddrescue:

ddrescue -r 2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sde1


Please note that up to this point, we haven’t touched /dev/sdb or /dev/sdd, the partitions that were part of the RAID array.

Now let’s rebuild the array using /dev/sde1 and /dev/sdf1:

mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=mirror --raid-devices=2 /dev/sd[e-f]1

Please note that in a real situation, you will typically use the same device names as with the original array, that is, /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc1 after the failed disks have been replaced with new ones.

In this article I have chosen to use extra devices to re-create the array with brand new disks and to avoid confusion with the original failed drives.

When asked whether to continue writing array, type Y and press Enter. The array should be started and you should be able to watch its progress with:

watch -n 1 cat /proc/mdstat

 Add the following lines to the [SeatDefaults] section: 

# don't sleep the screen

# Also usefull link for disabling sleep on LXDE
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/arch-29/screen-goes-blank-after-ten-minutes-in-lxde-how-to-change-this-769000/

X itself puts on this screensaver by default. You can check this with xset q. To disable, type

bash:$ xset s off

X also automatically puts your pc in standby after 20 minutes or something, and it puts it into hibernate after 30. It would turn it off after 10 more minutes if it could. To disable this too, type:

bash:$ xset -dpms

You can do this automatically when you log in successfully by putting these lines in ~/.xsessionrc:

robo@anonymous:~$ nano .xsessionrc
#add these lines without @ prefix
xset s noblank
xset s off
xset -dpms



nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

			...
	EndSection

	TapButton1
		(integer) configures which mouse-button is reported on a non-corner, one finger tap.
	TapButton2
		(integer) configures which mouse-button is reported on a non-corner, two finger tap
	TapButton3
		(integer) configures which mouse-button is reported on a non-corner, three finger tap
	RBCornerButton
		(integer) configures which mouse-button is reported on a right bottom corner, one finger tap (use Option "RBCornerButton" "3" to achieve Ubuntu style tap behaviour for right mouse button in lower right corner)
	RTCornerButton
		(integer) as above, but for top right corner, one finger tap.
	VertEdgeScroll
		(boolean) enables vertical scrolling while dragging across the right edge of the touch pad.
	HorizEdgeScroll
		(boolean) enables horizontal scrolling while dragging across the bottom edge of the touch pad.
	VertTwoFingerScroll
		(boolean) enables vertical scrolling using two fingers.
	HorizTwoFingerScroll
		(boolean) enables horizontal scrolling using two fingers.
	EmulateTwoFingerMinZ/W
		(integer) play with this value to set the precision of two finger scroll.
	FingerLow
		(integer) when finger pressure drops below this value, the driver counts it as a release.
	FingerHigh
		(integer) when finger pressure goes above this value, the driver counts it as a touch.
	MaxTapTime
		Determines how "crisp" a tap must be to be considered a real tap. Decrease the value to require a more crisp tap. Properly adjusting this parameter can reduce false positives when the hands hover over or lightly touch the pad.
	VertScrollDelta and HorizScrollDelta
		(integer) configures the speed of scrolling, it is a bit counter-intuitive because higher values produce greater precision and thus slower scrolling. Negative values cause natural scrolling like in macOS.

	Note:

		If you find that your hand frequently brushes your touchpad, causing the TapButton2 option to be triggered (which will more than likely paste from your clipboard), and you do not mind losing two-finger-tap functionality, set TapButton2 to 0. Alternatively, see #Disable touchpad while typing.
		Recent versions include a "Coasting" feature, enabled by default, which may have the undesired effect of continuing almost any scrolling until the next tap or click, even if you are no longer touching the touchpad. This means that to scroll just a bit, you need to scroll (by using the edge, or a multitouch option) and then almost immediately tap the touchpad, otherwise scrolling will continue forever. If wish to avoid this, set CoastingSpeed to 0.
		If your touchpad is too sensitive, use higher values for FingerLow and FingerHigh and vice versa. Remember that FingerLow should be smaller than FingerHigh

<pre>
	http://forum.lxde.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1374
	
	Because of the restricted access to the backlight adjustment program this is the most complicated part of the keybinding tutorial. Start by creating a script to adjust screen brightness when called from xbindkeys:
	
	File: /usr/bin/adjust_brightness.sh
	
	# The first argument is whether to increase the brightness (+) or
	# decrease the brightness (-).
	# The second argument is optional and indicates the step size when
	# increasing or decreasing the brightness. The default is 1.
	if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then exit 1; fi
	bright_file=""/sys/class/backlight/dcon-bl/brightness""
	mbright_file=""/sys/class/backlight/dcon-bl/max_brightness""
	while read line; do
	brightness=$line
	done < $(cat ""$bright_file"")
	while read line; do
	max_brightness=$line
	done < $(cat ""$mbright_file"")
	step=1
	if [ $# -gt 1 ]; then
	step=$2
	fi
	declare -i brightness
	if [ $1 = ""-"" ]; then
	if [ $brightness -ne 0 ]; then
	brightness=$brightness-$step;
	echo $brightness > /sys/class/backlight/dcon-bl/brightness
	fi
	else
	if [ $brightness -ne $max_brightness ]; then
	brightness=$brightness+$step;
	echo $brightness > $bright_file
	fi
	fi
	
	Don't worry if you don't understand the above script. You can just copy and paste the contents into the file you create when using the following command:
	# nano /usr/bin/adjust_brightness.sh
	
	Now you must make this file executable:
	# chmod a+x /usr/bin/adjust_brightness.sh
	
	Open the keybindings file and have the ""dim"" (c:75) and ""bright"" (c:76) keys execute the above script:
	# nano /home/olpc/.xbindkeysrc
	
	and paste the following before ""End of Xbindkeys configuration"" :
	## Reduce brightness
	""/usr/bin/adjust_brightness.sh -""
	c:75
	
	## Increase brightness
	""/usr/bin/adjust_brightness.sh +""
	c:76
	
	
	
	----------------------------------------------
	also chekc thath xbindkeys is installed
	
	#if not then for rpm based on yum install
	yum install xbindkeys

All commands should be given as the same user as mount point is later used, most likely as regular user if files are accessed using GUI tools and normal user permissions. Otherwise ifuse does not even show mount point for unpriviledged users.

% idevicepair pair
SUCCESS: Paired with device e430df2262310bc88e16abde812a526c36ce8076

Mount point directory /mnt/a must exist and be user writable. Images taken with camera, screenshots etc are under DCIM folder tree.

% ifuse /mnt/a
% mount | grep ifuse
ifuse                          57852424   12774908  45077516  23% /mnt/a

Unmounting (if not done and unplugging, those become stale and mountpoint cannot be reused):

% fusermount -u /mnt/a

If unmounting fails, regardless that nothing is using mount point anymore, try pulling cable and again:

% fusermount -u /mnt/a
fusermount: failed to unmount /mnt/a: Device or resource busy
% fusermount -u /mnt/a

<h1>OpenSSH Deny or Restrict Access To Users and Groups</h1>
<pre>
<a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/openssh-deny-or-restrict-access-to-users-and-groups.html" target="_blank">https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/openssh-deny-or-restrict-access-to-users-and-groups.html</a>

Restricting which users can log in

The syntax is:
DenyUsers user1 user2 user3
Use DenyUsers to block user login. You can use wild cards as well as user1@cyberciti.com (user1 is not allowed to login from cyberciti.com host) pattern.

DenyGroups group1 group2
A list of group names, if user is part of primary of supplementary group login access is denied. You can use wildcards. Please note that you cannot use a numeric group or username ID. If these directives are not used, default is to allow everyone.
Allowing selected users or group explicitly to log in

The syntax is:
AllowUsers user1 user2
This directive is opposite of DenyUsers directive i.e. user1 and user2 are only allowed to log in into the server.

AllowGroups group1 group2
This directive is opposite of DenyGroups directive i.e. members of group1 and group2 users are only allowed to log in into the server.



<h3>Examples</h3>
To help secure your OpenSSH based server you can be explicitly allowing users sai and vivek to log in via SSH. Edit the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config as the super user:

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Add/edit/append the following line:

AllowUsers sai vivek

Save and close the file. Next, restart your SSH daemon service.

Note that I'm working on Ubuntu 12.04, which uses postgresql 9.1.

There, I needed to:

 (apt-get | yum | dnf) install postgresql-contrib

find latest pgcrypto--.sql module 
for example pgcrypto--1.3.sql
it's located depends on OS and postgresql versions
in fedora 27 it is located in /usr/share/pgsql/extension
after that we have pgcrypto--x.sql file fo in database 
su - postgres
psql databasename
# and install extension
\i /usr/share/pgsql/extension/pgcrypto--1.3.sql
#then run command
CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;

then use command to generate crypted text
#for example 
update users set password=digest('1234','sha') where id=1
sets password with hex prefix \x
to set without prefix use encode function
update users set password=encode(digest('123','sha1'), 'hex') where id=1

<h1>Enable and Disable Journaling On EXT4 File Systems In Linux</h1>
<pre>
https://curiousviral.com/enable-and-disable-journaling/

Step 1: Unmount the file system partition where you want to apply it. let’s say, I have an ext4 file system mounted on /var/data with /dev/sda1.

umount /var/data
Step 2: Now Disable journaling for the system. We can use the below command.

tune4fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sda1
or

tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sda1
if Command not found, then install using yum install e2fsprogs e4fsprogs.

Check Out: Install Tomcat 10 Server Using Source Code On Linux 8

Step 3: Once the above task completed. We will perform a system check using e4fsck -f /dev/sda1

Step 4: Restart the Linux machine using shutdown -r now

we can use this command to create mkfs.ext4 -O ^has_journal /dev/sda1

Check Out: Docker Connection Error Desc Transport X509 Certificate

Step 5: it’s time to verify the journaling disabled using dmesg | grep EXT4

Note: Expected output similar to EXT4-fs (dm-3): mounted filesystem without journal. log journal file

You’re done disable j

https://gist.github.com/reillysiemens/ac6bea1e6c7684d62f544bd79b2182a4


1- Install mokutil package

sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install mokutil


2- Create RSA key under new folder.

sudo -i
mkdir /root/signed-modules
cd /root/signed-modules
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MOK.priv -outform DER -out MOK.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=VirtualBox/"
chmod 600 MOK.priv


3- This command will ask you to add a password, you need this password after the next reboot.

sudo mokutil --import MOK.der

4- Reboot your system and a blue screen appear, select Enroll MOK --> Continue --> put the previous password and your system will start.

5- Put the previous cmmands in a script to run it later (after system update)

cd /root/signed-modules
vi sign-virtual-box

Add the following cmd to this script :

#!/bin/bash

for modfile in $(dirname $(modinfo -n vboxdrv))/*.ko; do
echo "Signing $modfile"
/usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 \
/root/signed-modules/MOK.priv \
/root/signed-modules/MOK.der "$modfile"
done

5- Add exec permission and run the script

chmod 700 sign-virtual-box
./sign-virtual-box

6- Launch VirtualBOx

modprobe vboxdrv

<h1>How to change the docker image installation directory?</h1>
<pre>
https://stackoverflow.com/a/34731550/4359487


144

Following advice from comments I utilize Docker systemd documentation to improve this answer. Below procedure doesn't require reboot and is much cleaner.

First create directory and file for custom configuration:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
sudo $EDITOR /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/docker-storage.conf

For docker version before 17.06-ce paste:

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// --graph="/mnt"

For docker after 17.06-ce paste:

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --data-root="/mnt"

Alternative method through daemon.json

I recently tried above procedure with 17.09-ce on Fedora 25 and it seem to not work. Instead of that simple modification in /etc/docker/daemon.json do the trick:

{
    "graph": "/mnt",
    "storage-driver": "overlay"
}

Despite the method you have to reload configuration and restart Docker:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker

To confirm that Docker was reconfigured:

docker info|grep "loop file"

In recent version (17.03) different command is required:

docker info|grep "Docker Root Dir"

Output should look like this:

 Data loop file: /mnt/devicemapper/devicemapper/data
 Metadata loop file: /mnt/devicemapper/devicemapper/metadata

Or:

 Docker Root Dir: /mnt

Then you can safely remove old Docker storage:

rm -rf /var/lib/docker

<h1>How To Remove Docker Images, Containers, and Volumes</h1>
<pre>
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes

<h3>Purging All Unused or Dangling Images, Containers, Volumes, and Networks</h3>
Docker provides a single command that will clean up any resources — images, containers, volumes, and networks — that are dangling (not associated with a container):

    docker system prune

To additionally remove any stopped containers and all unused images (not just dangling images), add the -a flag to the command:

    docker system prune -a


<h3>Removing Docker Images</h3>
Remove one or more specific images

Use the docker images command with the -a flag to locate the ID of the images you want to remove. This will show you every image, including intermediate image layers. When you’ve located the images you want to delete, you can pass their ID or tag to docker rmi:

List:

    docker images -a

Remove:

    docker rmi Image Image
